So, i woke up at idk when but maybe at 9:xx and then i put the mat and blankets
of but while doing that i had to poop so i went upstairs real quick and my
father had just got off ig and then i went and poop. and then after doing so i
brushed and did things and came downstairs and then again went upstairs to
remove some blankets that we had put over the jaali/roshandan whatever you might
call it idk. it's a thing. and that was because it was raining yesterday and if
it did heavily it would be a problem and my mom could not make things as the
kitchen is not finished yk. anyway, that happened and i was thinking idk what
and then after some time when mom called me i went downstairs again and then
took some money to get some sabzi and jalebi from a nearby halwai and he had
been making samosa and longlatas so i came back and told and she told that it
might be because all the labourers would have been in the ghat because of chatt
puja thus they are not making that ig. and then she told i should have bought
samosas but whatever and then she is making tea and idk what and then i'm doing
some things over my pc. nothing much to say ig. but yeah my father shows
mad-like behaviour randomly. like he jokingly got mad at me and started hitting
with gamcha and then started dancing and after coming from the bath he said, why
haven't you prepared my undergarments, go get them quick or i'll toggle the
button switch (which was connected to wifi, ig) and i said ok but you had not
told me in advance and then my sister affirmed and then he said yeah i had not
said that. like what the f\*ck. atm it's 11:34.
