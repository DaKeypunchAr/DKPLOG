# October 23, 2025

This is me from 21:48 of 24, 2025. I was unable to write the log that day and
i'm doing it today. Well, lemme tell you what happened.

Did the basic waking up things. That day i didn't go to the shop because my
father did. My sister had toasted the bread that day and we had ate it.
I had started working on what? well on nothing really, I thought that today
(i.e., on 24) the school would have a civics viva examination as the _Baby Rose_
mam had told that she is going to take a viva after diwali and this was it.
Though unsure, it was a possibility i should be prepared about.

Whole mid-day kinda flowed the same though it has individual differences but
yeah the same. I was on discord and was trying to customize and do things and
learn about TWMs so that i can use one. And that's the reason i was unable to
focus on _**MEMORIZING SOME CIVICS WITHOUT KNOWING WHY THEY ARE THE WAY THEY ARE
SO THAT WE CAN FIX THE FAULTS WHICH WE KNOW EXISTS BECAUSE OF THE EXISTENCE OF
THE WORD "CORRUPTION"**_

Well anyway, i had like moved away at 18:30 or so, and then studied one chapter
thoroughly. And then did the basic end day things like going to shop near about
20:30 and ..............
I don't remember much, and i had forgotten about the log as well then.
